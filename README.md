Data:
In this project, we have used historical daily stock price data for Netflix from google websites.

Prerequisites:
Before running the code, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended for code exploration)
Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, yfinance

Code Explanation:
1. Data Preparation;
Loading historical stock price data.
Preprocessing the data: handling missing values, date conversion, feature engineering, etc.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA);
Visualizing the historical stock price trends.
Calculating statistical measures and correlations.

4. Feature Selection;
Identifying relevant features for prediction.

6. Model Selection;
Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM).
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

8. Model Training;
Training the selected machine learning models on the training data.

10. Model Evaluation;
Evaluating the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

11. Making Predictions;
Using the trained model to make future stock price predictions.

Results:
Include details of the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. You can also visualize your predictions compared to actual stock prices.
